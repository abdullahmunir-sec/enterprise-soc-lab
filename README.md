# Enterprise SOC Lab – Security Monitoring & Network Detection

This project documents the design and deployment of a virtualized enterprise-style Security Operations Center (SOC) lab.

The lab simulates a segmented corporate network and demonstrates how security teams monitor, detect, and investigate threats using host-based and network-based telemetry.

## Objectives

- Design a segmented network architecture
- Deploy Security Onion for network intrusion detection
- Mirror traffic using SPAN for passive monitoring
- Correlate logs across multiple sources for threat analysis

## Network Architecture

The lab environment consists of multiple isolated networks:

- **Internal LAN** hosting domain controller and user workstation
- **Attacker network** used to simulate malicious activity
- **SIEM network** hosting Splunk for centralized logging
- **Management network** used to administer security tools
- **Security Onion sensor** monitoring mirrored traffic
